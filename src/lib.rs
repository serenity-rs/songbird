//!
//! Songbird is an async, cross-library compatible voice system for Discord, written in Rust.
//! The library offers:
//!  * A standalone gateway frontend compatible with [serenity] and [twilight] using the
//!  `"gateway"` and `"[serenity/twilight]"` plus `"[rustls/native]"` features. You can even run
//!  driverless, to help manage your [lavalink] sessions.
//!  * A standalone driver for voice calls, via the `"driver"` feature. If you can create
//!  a `ConnectionInfo` using any other gateway, or language for your bot, then you
//!  can run the songbird voice driver.
//!  * Voice receive and RT(C)P packet handling via the `"receive"` feature.
//!  * SIMD-accelerated JSON decoding via the `"simd-json"` feature.
//!  * And, by default, a fully featured voice system featuring events, queues,
//!  seeking on compatible streams, shared multithreaded audio stream caches,
//!  and direct Opus data passthrough from DCA files.
//!
//! ## Intents
//! Songbird's gateway functionality requires you to specify the `GUILD_VOICE_STATES` intent.
//!
//! ## Examples
//! Full examples showing various types of functionality and integrations can be found
//! in [this crate's examples directory].
//!
//! ## Codec support
//! Songbird supports all [codecs and formats provided by Symphonia] (pure-Rust), with Opus support
//! provided by [audiopus] (an FFI wrapper for libopus).
//!
//! **By default, *Songbird will not request any codecs from Symphonia*.** To change this, in your own
//! project you will need to depend on Symphonia as well.
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Including songbird alone gives you support for Opus via the DCA file format.
//! [dependencies.songbird]
//! version = "0.4"
//! features = ["builtin-queue"]
//!
//! # To get additional codecs, you *must* add Symphonia yourself.
//! # This includes the default formats (MKV/WebM, Ogg, Wave) and codecs (FLAC, PCM, Vorbis)...
//! [dependencies.symphonia]
//! version = "0.5"
//! features = ["aac", "mp3", "isomp4", "alac"] # ...as well as any extras you need!
//! ```
