//! Runner for a voice connection.
//!
//! Songbird's driver is a mixed-sync system, using:
//!  * Asynchronous connection management, event-handling, and gateway integration.
//!  * Synchronous audio mixing, packet generation, and encoding.
//!
//! This splits up work according to its IO/compute bound nature, preventing packet
//! generation from being slowed down past its deadline, or from affecting other
//! asynchronous tasks your bot must handle.
