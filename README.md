# Songbird

![](songbird.png)

Songbird is an async, cross-library compatible voice system for Discord, written in Rust.
The library offers:
 * A standalone gateway frontend compatible with [serenity] and [twilight] using the
 `"gateway"` and `"[serenity/twilight]"` plus `"[rustls/native]"` features. You can even run
 driverless, to help manage your [lavalink] sessions.
 * A standalone driver for voice calls, via the `"driver"` feature. If you can create
 a `ConnectionInfo` using any other gateway, or language for your bot, then you
 can run the songbird voice driver.
 * Voice receive and RT(C)P packet handling via the `"receive"` feature.
 * SIMD-accelerated JSON decoding via the `"simd-json"` feature.
 * And, by default, a fully featured voice system featuring events, queues,
 seeking on compatible streams, shared multithreaded audio stream caches,
 and direct Opus data passthrough from DCA files.

## Intents
Songbird's gateway functionality requires you to specify the `GUILD_VOICE_STATES` intent.

## Codec support
Songbird supports all [codecs and formats provided by Symphonia] (pure-Rust), with Opus support
provided by [audiopus] (an FFI wrapper for libopus).

**By default, *Songbird will not request any codecs from Symphonia*.** To change this, in your own
project you will need to depend on Symphonia as well.

```toml
# Including songbird alone gives you support for Opus via the DCA file format.
[dependencies.songbird]
version = "0.4"
features = ["builtin-queue"]

# To get additional codecs, you *must* add Symphonia yourself.
# This includes the default formats (MKV/WebM, Ogg, Wave) and codecs (FLAC, PCM, Vorbis)...
[dependencies.symphonia]
version = "0.5.2"
features = ["aac", "mp3", "isomp4", "alac"] # ...as well as any extras you need!
```

## Dependencies
Songbird needs a few system dependencies before you can use it.

- Opus - Audio codec that Discord uses.
[audiopus] will use installed libopus binaries if available via pkgconf on Linux/MacOS, otherwise you will need to install cmake to build opus from source.
This is always the case on Windows.
For Unix systems, you can install the library with `apt install libopus-dev` on Ubuntu or `pacman -S opus` on Arch Linux.
If you do not have it installed it will be built for you. However, you will need a C compiler and the GNU autotools installed.
Again, these can be installed with `apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool m4` on Ubuntu or `pacman -S base-devel` on Arch Linux.

This is a required dependency. Songbird cannot work without it.

- yt-dlp / youtube-dl / (similar forks) - Audio/Video download tool.
yt-dlp can be installed [according to the installation instructions on the main repo].
You can install youtube-dl with Python's package manager, pip, which we recommend for youtube-dl. You can do it with the command `pip install youtube_dl`.
Alternatively, you can install it with your system's package manager, `apt install youtube-dl` on Ubuntu or `pacman -S youtube-dl` on Arch Linux.

This is an optional dependency for users, but is required as a dev-dependency. It allows Songbird to download audio/video sources from the Internet from a variety of webpages, which it will convert to the Opus audio format Discord uses.
