# Changelog

## [0.1.0] — 2021-01-XX — **Robin**

We're very excited to publish and announce the first release of Songbird, an async Rust voice library for Discord!
It's been a long time coming, but all the hard work has paid off in bringing the first version of this library to completion.

Thanks to the following for their contributions:

Songbird is based heavily on serenity's `voice` module, which has served as its base design, informed many of the design changes, and paved a lot of the API/protocol research needed.
