//! Live, controllable audio instances.
//!
//! Tracks add control and event data around the bytestreams offered by [`Input`],
//! where each represents a live audio source inside of the driver's mixer. This includes
//! play state, volume, and looping behaviour.
//!
//! To configure an audio source as it is created, you can create a [`Track`] to set the
//! above playback state [from any `Input` or `T: Into<Input>`](Track#trait-implementations)
//! using `Track::from(...)`.
//!
//! To configure an audio source once it has been given to a [`Driver`], you are given a
//! [`TrackHandle`] once you hand the [`Input`] and state over to be played. These handles
//! remotely send commands from your bot's (a)sync context to control playback, register events,
//! and execute synchronous closures. This design prevents user code from being able to lock
//! or stall the audio mixer.
//!
